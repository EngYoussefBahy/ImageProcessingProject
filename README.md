# Image Compression using 2D DCT

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop an image compression system using **DCT** on 8x8 blocks to efficiently reduce image sizes while maintaining visual quality

## Steps

- Read an input image file.
- Extract and display each of its three color components.
- Compress the image by processing each color component in blocks of 8 Ã— 8 pixels.
- Convert each block into the frequency domain using 2D DCT and retain only a few coefficients.
- Compare the sizes of the original and compressed images.
- Decompress the image by applying inverse 2D DCT to the retained coefficients.
- Measure the quality of the decompressed image using PSNR.
